1. Create the main tabs including alarm-clock, world-clock, stop-watch and time-counter.
2. Implement world-clock (ListView, BaseAdapter), stop-watch and time-counter (AsyncTask, Task reminder) --Dat
3. Implement the main page and alarm-clock (similar to the one in nexus) --Binh

TODO decide: How to recognize voice commands?

1. Google now: easy but not flexible!

	supported devices: "Also, Google have restricted certain Jelly Bean devices from using the offline recognition 
		due to hardware constraints. Which devices this applies to is not documented, in fact, nothing is documented, 
		so configuring the capabilities for the user has proved to be a matter of trial and error (for them). 
		It works for some straight away – For those that it doesn't, this is the ‘guide’ I supply them with."
		
2. New implementation: more difficult, time-consuming but brings a lot of benefits. E.g.:
	Focus on a small area: pre-defined commands.
	Fast to add new languages, especially Vietnamese.
	Less risky in terms of privacy.

----------09/02/2014 idea---------
- Allow users to create their own ringtones (voice of their gf/bf :D).
- Allow users to add additional note which would be talked when alarm on
- Consider: 
  + Stock/Gold price
  + Feed
  
----------22/02/2014 idea---------
Command:
- Weather
- Voice control
   + Stop
